# App capability extension v1

`sdk/app/RiscRuntimeV1.h` retains its original ABI prefix and appends acquire and
release. Require api_version1, struct_size>=RISC_RUNTIME_CAPABILITIES_V1_SIZE and
both callbacks. Initialize `risc_runtime_capability_v1.struct_size`, then acquire
by capability/version and optional exact instance ID. Zero means the uniquely
authorized selected instance; no registry-order fallback. Before casting api,
check the capability's own version and full table size. Release capability-owned
frames/sessions first, then release the grant. App resources and callbacks must
not outlive app_main/fini. Remaining grants are revoked before memory/image
teardown; failed revocation retains the invocation and blocks handoff.

The owner-provisioned immutable boot store declares policy, not the app itself:

```json
{
  "board": "board.json",
  "default_app": "default.elf",
  "drivers": [],
  "app_capabilities": [{
    "manifest": "default.json",
    "grants": [
      {"capability": "display.output", "api": 1, "instance_id": 5},
      {"capability": "rtc.clock", "api": 2, "instance_id": 8}
    ]
  }]
}
```

Populate drivers with the explicit external driver closure. A referenced app
manifest has typeapplication, id, version, architecturextensa-esp32s3,
file_namedefault.elf, entryapp_main, and requires entries `{capability,api}`.
The ELF is the manifest's safe basename beside that manifest. The loader binds
this exact path to manifest identity/version and the intersection of declared
requirements with authorized grants before any ELF runs. Missing, extra,
duplicate or ambiguous grants fail boot. This is provisioning consistency for
trusted native code, not a signature scheme or memory sandbox.

Limits are8 app policies,8 declared capabilities per app,16 live app grants.
All grant handles have nonreused generations; stale handles, wrong API/instance,
short output structs and calls outside the owner app are rejected. Child paths
without their own policy get no capability grants; policy is not inherited.
Health, diagnostic, cooperative yield and launch remain available through the
original ABI. Apps using only that prefix need no policy/manifest change.

Ordinary selected capabilities are opaque to the runtime. The example numbers
are deployment selections, not runtime code. `display.output@1` uses the complete
canonical display table. `rtc.clock@2` may use a driver's existing table; a clock
app can call only read and show TIME UNSET on invalid time, without seeding it.
Raw platform GPIO/SPI/hardware records are not exposed to apps. The sole optional
native app service is an explicitly granted global platform.clock; ordinary
clock apps can use health.uptime_ms and yield_ms instead. yield_ms continues the
inherited bounded provider poll dispatcher so queued display work progresses.
